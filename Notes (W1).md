### Week 1 Notes

**Filter Image Result By Color**
- key idea: posting a general query, and then filtering the result
- filtering image results by color
- *Google Image Search*, enable tools function
- filter by *colors*, *types*, and *suggested points*

**How Google Works**
- [searching among the *spider-web*](https://youtu.be/Md7K90FfJhg)

**The art of keyword choice**
- think about what you're trying to find
    - queries should be short, to the point, and important words
    - sometimes, an alternate keyword can be tried
    - can directly put questions as queries (even can specify the unit)
- choose words that you think will appear on the page
- put yourself in the mindset of the author of those words

**Word Order Matters**
- especially special noun
- capitalization does not matter in google searches
- google queries can include most of the special characters like copy right, not equal sign, square root, emojis, math symbols...
- punctuation does not matter
- beware of special exceptions like "C++, C#" (few characters can make special difference)
- no space in between means seach as a special unit for that combination
- google has spelling correction properties
- putting words inside "" means I want that exact phrase or word

**Finding Text On Webpage**
- Ctrl + F
