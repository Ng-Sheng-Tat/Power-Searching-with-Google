### Week 3 Notes

- green one is the deep web, which is not searchable

**Operators (serve to filter the result)**
- [what to search site:standford.edu]: only search within the standford websites

<img src="topleveldomain.png" alt = "Top Level Domain">

- using the same operators of ":", pleaces restriction search result from the domain name only
- usually uses "site:.GOV or .MIL or .EDU"

**Filetype**
- [what to search filetype:pdf OR filetype:xls site:.edu]

**Removing invasive results with minue (-)**
- [what to search -what we do not want -what we do not want also ...]
- there is no space after the minus sign
- A plus sign (+) does not mean “and” nor does it force inclusion of a word. Google can search for certain plus signs after a word (for example, C++ or Google+). A plus sign before a search term, used as an operator, looks for a Google+ Page by that name.

**OR and quotes**
- quotes are used to search for an exact phrase with the exact order
- uses to search for specific spelling, which is wrong in spelling in normal case
- "OR" operator is not a filter, but it *adds* more results to your search
- the results are merged together, useful when you search for synonymous term

**intext: and Advanced Search**
- the ``intext:`` operator requires that some bit of text be on the results page returned in the SERP
- [site:stanford.edu "phrase" intext:geophysics]
- enabling advanced search feature -> bottom right settings or in the middle top settings -> advanced search or just google [Google Advanced Search]
