### Week 5 Notes

**Credibility**
- ranking means relevancy of your result and search keywords but it does not represents credibility
- choosing appropriate terms for your query
    - be aware that different terms make different implications
- can verify credibility by looking for fact-checking sites; sites that you know to be credible. Do one more search if the results cause you big emotional reaction
- need to *triangulate* that is to correlate different perspectives and come out with a unified view on a topic by taking multiple views
- try to think about the search terms you use and look for multiple perspectives, and use all the information that you have
    - check the url to see inside the story
    - range-checking: use date-range search to see when it first appears
    - use time range to filter

**Variant Data**
- compare various results even when you asked for circumferences of the earth (circumpolar vs equatorial)
    - depending on how you search it and when you search it
- identify the sources of the information especially from bloggers
- do not bake your answer into your queries

    - they are equivalent to [site:domainname.com]
